in this doc we are going to see how to query between relational models or relational managers .

* MANY TO MANY relations :
=> example : M2M relation between Category and Product.

class Category(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField()
  products = models.ManyToManyField()

q1 = access to product throgh category object (access to products of a category ):
-> sport_category = Category.objects.get(name='sport')
-> sport_products = sport_category.products.all()

'products' is the name of relational variable in model.

q2 =  access to categories of a product:
-> product = Product.objects.get(name='shirt')
-> categories_of_product = product.category_set.all()

============================================================================


* ONE TO MANY relations :
=> example : one to many relatioon between Product and ProductImages :

class ProductImages(models.Model):
  image = models.ImageField
  product= models.ForeignKeyField('Product',on_delete=models.CASCADE)
  
  q1 = get product of ProductImages object :
 -> product_image = ProductImages.objects.get(pk=3)
 -> product_of_image = product_image.product
 
 q2 = how to access the property of product of a image :
-> product_name = product_image.product_name
 
 q3 = how to access to ProductImages objects of a Product object :
 -> product = Product.objects.get(pk=1)
 -> product.productimages_set.all()
